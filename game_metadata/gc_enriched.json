The game follows the storyline of the book and film, with adding in new scenes to make the game more action-oriented, as well as changing the affiliation of the main villains. Additionally, it features many elements of later Bond films to recreate the feel of the era such as the Aston Martin DB5 that debuted in Goldfinger (1964) and the jet pack from Thunderball (1965). From Russia with Love is also notable in that it is the first video game to use Sean Connery's younger likeness as James Bond and the first to include all new voice work by the actor after twenty-two years away from the role. From Russia with Love is the last James Bond video game EA Games marketed before they lost the rights to Activision in 2006.",

It is the ninth main installment in the Fire Emblem series, and the third to be released in the west. As with previous installments, gameplay revolves around positioning characters on a battlefield with the aim of defeating an opposing force. If characters are defeated in battle, they are removed from the rest of the game.\nThe story takes place in Tellius, a separate world from other Fire Emblem games. Tellius is a continent inhabited by the humanoid Beorc and the shapeshifting Laguz. The game begins when the Beorc nation of Daein invades Crimea, a fellow Beorc nation. The protagonist, a mercenary named Ike, discovers Princess Elincia, the last heir to the throne of Crimea, and begins a journey to restore her to the throne. Ike and his group travel across Tellius to form alliances with the other countries and free Crimea from Daein's control, confronting racial tensions and long-standing resentment between the Beorc and the Laguz along the way.\nPath of Radiance began development for the GameCube after the overseas success of the Game Boy Advance game Fire Emblem, becoming the first home console entry in the series since Fire Emblem: Thracia 776. The game is the first entry in the series to feature 3D graphics, full motion cutscenes, and voice acting. The series' transition to 3D caused multiple difficulties for the developers. The localization team worked closely with Intelligent Systems to ensure the localization was as true to the original Japanese as possible. Upon release, the game received widespread critical acclaim for its gameplay and story, but several journalistic sites and magazines made negative comments about the game's graphics. The game debuted at the top of Japanese gaming charts, and was considered to have sold well. A direct sequel for the Wii, Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn, was released in 2007 in North America and Japan, and 2008 in Europe and Australia.",

While primarily a BMX-based action sports title, it earned most of its notoriety for containing nudity, foul language and adult humor. The game allows the player to create female characters that are fully topless and view live-action video clips of real life strippers, also with bare breasts. Consequently, BMX XXX was initially denied classification in Australia. In North America, while the game is available uncensored on the GameCube and Xbox, all naked breasts are covered in the PlayStation 2 version. While the adult content garnered a great deal of publicity for the game, it was almost entirely negative, and it was eventually released to mediocre reviews and poor sales.",

It was preceded by Mario Kart: Super Circuit from 2001 and was followed by the handheld game Mario Kart DS, which was released for the Nintendo DS in 2005.\nSimilar to previous titles, Double Dash!! challenges Mario series player characters to race against each other on Mario-themed tracks. The game introduced a number of new gameplay features, such as supporting co-op gameplay with two riders per kart. One player drives the kart, and the other uses items. Players can switch at any time. Double Dash!! is the only game in the Mario Kart series to allow cooperative gameplay so far. Double Dash!! supports LAN play using the Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter, allowing up to 16 players to compete simultaneously. There are 20 characters to select from in total, each of which with a special item, and with eleven characters being new to the series.\nDouble Dash!! received positive reviews by critics; it attained an aggregated score of 87 out of 100 on Metacritic. Reviewers praised the graphics and the new gameplay features, but elements of the voice acting were poorly received.

Some of the stages included in this game are Woodward Camp, Venice, Greenville, North Carolina, and the Manhattan train yards.</p>",

      "description": "Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is a tactical role-playing video game developed by Intelligent Systems and Nintendo SPD, and published by Nintendo for the GameCube home console in 2005. It is the ninth main installment in the Fire Emblem series, and the third to be released in the west. As with previous installments, gameplay revolves around positioning characters on a battlefield with the aim of defeating an opposing force. If characters are defeated in battle, they are removed from the rest of the game.\nThe story takes place in Tellius, a separate world from other Fire Emblem games. Tellius is a continent inhabited by the humanoid Beorc and the shapeshifting Laguz. The game begins when the Beorc nation of Daein invades Crimea, a fellow Beorc nation. The protagonist, a mercenary named Ike, discovers Princess Elincia, the last heir to the throne of Crimea, and begins a journey to restore her to the throne. Ike and his group travel across Tellius to form alliances with the other countries and free Crimea from Daein's control, confronting racial tensions and long-standing resentment between the Beorc and the Laguz along the way.\nPath of Radiance began development for the GameCube after the overseas success of the Game Boy Advance game Fire Emblem, becoming the first home console entry in the series since Fire Emblem: Thracia 776. The game is the first entry in the series to feature 3D graphics, full motion cutscenes, and voice acting. The series' transition to 3D caused multiple difficulties for the developers. The localization team worked closely with Intelligent Systems to ensure the localization was as true to the original Japanese as possible. Upon release, the game received widespread critical acclaim for its gameplay and story, but several journalistic sites and magazines made negative comments about the game's graphics. The game debuted at the top of Japanese gaming charts, and was considered to have sold well. A direct sequel for the Wii, Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn, was released in 2007 in North America and Japan, and 2008 in Europe and Australia.",

A nasty encounter with\nDr. No costs him an eye, but Goldfinger’s technicians replace it with a\ngold-hued, synthetic and upgradeable eye, earning him the name\n\"GoldenEye.\" Now it’s payback time, Dr. No.\n\nOn your quest for revenge, you'll encounter such legendary Bond baddies\nas Oddjob, Scaramanga and Xenia Onatopp. GoldenEye: Rogue Agent lets you\nslip into the dark side as a ruthless and unpredictable bad guy with\nlots of big weapons and cool devices. The GoldenEye gadget, an\ninfinitely cool device worthy of Q himself, and the heads-up-display\n(HUD) let you see enemies through cover, hack electronics and weapons,\ndeflect damage, monitor ammo levels, decode locks and more.\n\nYou can wield two weapons at once or go one-on-one with a muscular melee\nfighting system lets you throw and cold-cock enemies, seize hostages and\nmore. Left and right-handed gameplay controls, plus stylus and thumb-pad\nplay, take full advantage of the DS's unique touch-screen capabilities.\n\nOne of the keys to GoldenEye: Rogue Agent is its array of control\nschemes. The touch screen isn't going to be for everyone, and some will\nwant inverted controls or auto aiming and leveling. There's no greater\ndisappointment than playing a first-person shooter and being unable to\ncontrol your player's movement, leaving you a sitting duck. Once you\nfind the control scheme that works for you, you'll be scampering through\neach level with guns blazing.\n\nWhen you come across a weapon on the ground, you will need to tap the\ntouch screen to pick it up. The bottom left and bottom right each\nrepresent a hand. Tap the bottom left to pick up the gun with your left\nhand, and the right corner for your right hand. The L and R Buttons are\nyour triggers for this rapid-fire adventure.\n\nThe story mode follows the same story as the GCN game. It's a solid,\nunpretentious FPS. But what sets GoldenEye DS apart are the righteously\ngreat multiplayer modes.\n\nIf you have one Game Card, up to eight players can wirelessly frag each\nother. Just host a game and have your friends choose Download Play from\nthe DS's menu. If you and your friends have multiple Game Cards,\nGoldenEye: Rogue Agent offers four game modes and a wider variety of\ncharacters and maps.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe muliplayer arenas make GoldenEye: Rogue Agent a great title for the\nNintendo DS.",

A version for Microsoft Windows developed by Ritual Entertainment was cancelled during development. The game was published on all platforms by Electronic Arts. Originally released in North America for the PlayStation 2 in October 2002, it was released in November for the Game Boy Advance, in December for the Xbox and GameCube, and in May 2003 for mobile. In November 2003, EA released a sequel, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.\nThe game is an adaptation of Peter Jackson's 2001 film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and his 2002 film The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, which was released shortly after the game. As it is not an adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's 1954 novel The Two Towers, the second volume in his Lord of the Rings trilogy, anything from the novel not specifically mentioned or depicted in the films could not be represented in the game. This is because, at the time, Vivendi Universal Games, in partnership with Tolkien Enterprises, held the rights to the video game adaptations of Tolkien's literary works, whilst Electronic Arts held the rights to the video game adaptations of the New Line Cinema films. EA chose not to publish a game based on Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring film, instead incorporating some of the plot and footage into their The Two Towers game, which was released a few weeks after Vivendi's The Fellowship of the Ring game, a licensed adaptation of Tolkien's novel The Fellowship of the Ring.\nThe Two Towers received a generally positive response, with critics praising the re-creation of sets and scenes from the films, and the epic scope of some of the battles. Some, however, criticized the game for being too short and the combat overly repetitive. The game was a financial success, selling almost four million units, and outselling Vivendi's The Fellowship of the Ring game, which sold just over one million.",

With deeper customization, FIFA 2002 is set to dominate the competition.\n\nAll-new tackling and referee models let players angle and time tackle to determine success (or get a potential card from the referee). Cinematic cutscenes seamlessly capture all the impact, pain, and emotion of a world-class game. Hardcore in-game animations capture the rough-and-tumble aspects of soccer with increased physical contact, giant collisions, and crunching falls. Authentic light sourcing delivers dynamic player shading and accentuated physical detail as players pass in and out of shadows.\n\nFIFA 2002 gives players the choice of more than 75 licensed national teams and 16 licensed leagues, including the English Premier League, German Bundesliga, Spanish Premier League, the French LNF, and Major League Soccer.

Goals could come from a variety of sources; crosses, corners, penalties, free kicks, passing plays, solo runs, lobbed efforts and long range drives. The game continued the trend of having player's with different attributes, both visually and with regards to their style on the pitch; pacey wingers out wide, large target men up front, shorter centre forwards trying to cause problems for defenders with their skill running on the ball.",

The player controls series protagonist Link as he attempts to save his sister from the sorcerer Ganon and becomes embroiled in a struggle for the Triforce, a sacred relic that grants its holder's wishes. Aided by allies including pirate captain Tetra – an incarnation of Princess Zelda – and a talking boat named the King of Red Lions, Link sails the ocean, explores islands, and traverses dungeons to acquire the power necessary to defeat Ganon. Wind, which facilitates sailing, plays a prominent role, and can be controlled with a magic conductor's baton called the Wind Waker.\nThe Wind Waker was directed by Eiji Aonuma and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. It retains the basic 3D gameplay of its predecessors, Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, but with a distinctive cartoon-like art style created through cel shading. The game received widespread critical acclaim, but the art style proved divisive among players, which contributed to comparatively weak sales. As a result, Nintendo changed directions with the next Zelda installment, the more realistically-styled Twilight Princess.

      "description": "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an action hack and slash video game developed by Stormfront Studios for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It was ported to the Game Boy Advance by Griptonite Games, to the GameCube by Hypnos Entertainment, and to mobile by JAMDAT. A version for Microsoft Windows developed by Ritual Entertainment was cancelled during development. The game was published on all platforms by Electronic Arts. Originally released in North America for the PlayStation 2 in October 2002, it was released in November for the Game Boy Advance, in December for the Xbox and GameCube, and in May 2003 for mobile. In November 2003, EA released a sequel, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.\nThe game is an adaptation of Peter Jackson's 2001 film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and his 2002 film The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, which was released shortly after the game. As it is not an adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's 1954 novel The Two Towers, the second volume in his Lord of the Rings trilogy, anything from the novel not specifically mentioned or depicted in the films could not be represented in the game. This is because, at the time, Vivendi Universal Games, in partnership with Tolkien Enterprises, held the rights to the video game adaptations of Tolkien's literary works, whilst Electronic Arts held the rights to the video game adaptations of the New Line Cinema films. EA chose not to publish a game based on Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring film, instead incorporating some of the plot and footage into their The Two Towers game, which was released a few weeks after Vivendi's The Fellowship of the Ring game, a licensed adaptation of Tolkien's novel The Fellowship of the Ring.\nThe Two Towers received a generally positive response, with critics praising the re-creation of sets and scenes from the films, and the epic scope of some of the battles. Some, however, criticized the game for being too short and the combat overly repetitive.

      "description_html": "<p>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an action hack and slash video game developed by Stormfront Studios for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It was ported to the Game Boy Advance by Griptonite Games, to the GameCube by Hypnos Entertainment, and to mobile by JAMDAT. A version for Microsoft Windows developed by Ritual Entertainment was cancelled during development. The game was published on all platforms by Electronic Arts. Originally released in North America for the PlayStation 2 in October 2002, it was released in November for the Game Boy Advance, in December for the Xbox and GameCube, and in May 2003 for mobile. In November 2003, EA released a sequel, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.<br />\nThe game is an adaptation of Peter Jackson&#39;s 2001 film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and his 2002 film The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, which was released shortly after the game. As it is not an adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien&#39;s 1954 novel The Two Towers, the second volume in his Lord of the Rings trilogy, anything from the novel not specifically mentioned or depicted in the films could not be represented in the game. This is because, at the time, Vivendi Universal Games, in partnership with Tolkien Enterprises, held the rights to the video game adaptations of Tolkien&#39;s literary works, whilst Electronic Arts held the rights to the video game adaptations of the New Line Cinema films. EA chose not to publish a game based on Jackson&#39;s The Fellowship of the Ring film, instead incorporating some of the plot and footage into their The Two Towers game, which was released a few weeks after Vivendi&#39;s The Fellowship of the Ring game, a licensed adaptation of Tolkien&#39;s novel The Fellowship of the Ring.<br />\nThe Two Towers received a generally positive response, with critics praising the re-creation of sets and scenes from the films, and the epic scope of some of the battles.

Throw like the pros do, as well as hike,\ncatch, juke and stiff arm.\n• Exclusive multiplayer mini-games:\nWii-Only Mini Games designed to support four player gameplay. \"2 on 2\"\nbrings back school yard football but using NFL players, Y.A.C Attack\nmakes the action 3 on 1 as each player gets a shot at QB versus 3\ndefenders. Kicking Combine gives you a fast paced FreeMotion field goal\nkicking challenge\n• New Wii multiplayer enhancements: Wii only\nMultplayer enhancements increase the fun factor for up to four players.\nMultiplayer Sprint allows users help a teammate by boosting sprint speed\nand players can control the wind in Kicking Combine.\n• New play\ncalling system designed for basic football fan knowledge: Simplified\nfootball play calls makes the game easy to pick up and play. Pick plays\nby play type using basic tactics of football like short pass or outside\nrun. More advanced Madden fans can still use the full NFL playbooks like\nany other version of Madden.\n• Madden in-game tutorials: New in-game\ntutorials teach users how to use new FreeMotion controls and allow users\nto practice within the game.\n\nThe game may be the same brand of excellent Madden NFL football you're\nused to, but the playing field is very different.\n\nWith the new FreeMotion controls, Madden NFL 07 successfully\nincorporates the flick of the wrist in addition to the push of a button.\nNow to pass the ball, players flick the controller forward. The faster\nthe flick, the faster the pass. Slow flicks generate a long pass to give\nthe receiver time to get under the ball. Jukes are now controlled by\nmoving the Nunchuk controller left or right. Gamers generate a stiff are\nby moving the Wii Remote controller right or left.\n\nThose who have played previous versions of the Madden NFL franchise will\ncertainly know the gameplay mechanics, from defensive line shifts to\noffensive hot routes. The key to being successful at Madden NFL 07 for\nWii is to trust your instincts rather than reacting with buttons.\n\nPassing, for one, is a test of touch. How fast or how hard should you\nthrow that pass? In your playbook, each available receiver is designated\nby a direction on the Control Pad. To pass to this receiver during the\nplay, you simply press the Control Pad direction and flick the Remote to\npass. Each play has a preferred receiver for whom the play is designed.\nTo pass to him, all you need to do is flick the Remote, no accompanying\ndirection necessary.\n\nThe running game is where FreeMotion control shines, mostly because\nrushing the ball is truly a test of anticipation, reaction and power. As\nyou run, you can see what tacklers stand in your way. Once they're close\nenough, that's when you react, whether you juke or blast them with a\nstiff arm. Once they think they have you wrapped up, sometimes you've\ngiven the chance to power through them by pushing both controllers\nforward. There's something extremely satisfying about physically\nplanting a stiff arm in someone's facemask. You can't get that in any\nother football game.\n\nDefense also gets a FreeMotion upgrade as pushing the controllers\nforward can help you deliver the big hit. When you're playing in the\nsecondary, flicking the remote will give your defender a chance to swat\nat the ball. It's this level of integration that really revolutionizes\nMadden NFL 07 without forsaking the gameplay elements gamers have come\naccustomed to.\n\nBottom Line\nThe football franchise dives into the end zone and\nscores with a motion system that gets gamers in the game without going\nover the top.\n",

Other playable modes include Exhibition Mode, in which players choose the leader and the other rosters in the team and challenge another team to a single baseball game, and Minigames where the player must complete a certain mission. A common power-up in the game is a charged swing, a hit by a baseball bat performed by a character that will give the ball a strong hit, causing the length of a normal hit baseball to be twice as powerful.\nOverall, the game was well received by critics, gaining an 8 out of 10 from GameSpot.",

Mega Man Anniversary Collection contains the first eight games in the original Mega Man series, which debuted on the Nintendo Entertainment System with the first six games, moved to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System with the seventh game, and then moved again to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn with the eighth game. The plot follows the robotic protagonist Mega Man in his continuing adventures battling the evil Dr. Wily and his army of Robot Masters.\nEach game has a nearly identical structure in which the player traverses a series of themed stages to face off against boss robots, gain new weapons and abilities, then defeat Dr. Wily in a final confrontation. An extra feature is the \"Navi Mode\" for the first six titles, which provides hints and pathways for completing each stage. In addition to these eight games, Mega Man Anniversary Collection includes two unlockable fighting games (Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters), which had a limited release outside Japan. These two titles are similar in gameplay but a bit more stream-lined. The battles cut straight to the bosses, who get progressively more difficult with each one defeated.

When an assault on a Force Metal mining island occurs, a \"Maverick Hunter\" team led by Mega Man X is sent out in response. Command Mission differs from previous entries in the series in that it is a turn-based role-playing game (RPG) rather than an action-platform game. Force Metal can be equipped to each playable character to gain special abilities.\nThe game was developed by many of the team members who previously worked on Capcom's Breath of Fire series of RPGs. According to the producer of Command Mission, a plot-focused RPG based on the Mega Man X games was created because the series is well known for its action and storyline.

Metroid Prime is the fifth main installment in the Metroid series, and the first Metroid game to use 3D computer graphics. Because exploration takes precedence over combat, Nintendo classifies the game as a first-person adventure rather than a first-person shooter. On the same day as its North American release, Nintendo also released the Game Boy Advance game Metroid Fusion, marking the return of the Metroid series after an eight-year hiatus following Super Metroid (1994).\nMetroid Prime is the first of the three-part Prime storyline, which takes place between the original Metroid and Metroid II: Return of Samus. Like previous games in the series, Metroid Prime has a science fiction setting in which players control the bounty hunter Samus Aran. The story follows Samus as she battles the Space Pirates and their biological experiments on the planet Tallon IV. The game was a collaboration between Retro's staff in Austin, Texas, and Japanese Nintendo employees, including producer Shigeru Miyamoto, who suggested the project after visiting Retro's headquarters in 2000.\nThe game garnered critical praise and commercial success, selling more than a million units in North America alone. It won a number of Game of the Year awards, and it is considered by many critics and gamers to be one of the greatest video games ever made, remaining one of the highest-rated games on Metacritic. In 2009, an enhanced version was released for the Wii as a standalone game in Japan, and as part of the Metroid Prime Trilogy compilation internationally.",

      "description": "Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is a first person action-adventure video game developed by Retro Studios and published by Nintendo for the GameCube video game console. It is the seventh published game in the Metroid series, a sequel to Metroid Prime, and the first game in the series with a multiplayer feature. Echoes was released in North America, Europe, and Australia in 2004; and in Japan under the name Metroid Prime 2: Dark Echoes in May 2005.\nThe story of Echoes follows bounty hunter Samus Aran after she is sent to rescue Galactic Federation Marines from a ship near Aether, a planet inhabited by a race known as the Luminoth. There, she discovers that the troops were slaughtered by the Ing, a race that came from an alternate dimension of Aether. Samus must travel to three temples to ensure the destruction of the Ing, while battling Space Pirates and her mysterious doppelgänger called Dark Samus.\nRetro decided to make the game different from its predecessor by adding more focus on storyline and including new gameplay elements. Nintendo launched a viral marketing campaign to promote the game that included several websites written as if taking place in the Metroid universe. Echoes' single player mode and graphics were praised by critics, while its steep difficulty level and multiplayer components were met less positively. Since its release, Echoes has received several video game industry awards, as well as spots on \"top games\" lists by Nintendo Power and IGN. Over 800,000 copies of the game were sold worldwide. In 2009, an enhanced version was released for Wii as a standalone game in Japan and as part of Metroid Prime: Trilogy internationally.",

It was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in October 2004, and for the Nintendo GameCube in March 2005. Mortal Kombat: Deception follows the storyline from the fifth installment, Deadly Alliance. Its story centers on the revival of the Dragon King Onaga, who attempts to conquer the realms featured in the series after defeating the sorcerers Quan Chi and Shang Tsung, the main antagonists in the previous game, and the Thunder God Raiden, defender of Earthrealm. The surviving warriors from the previous titles join forces to confront Onaga.\nTwenty-six characters are available to play in the game, with nine making their first appearance in the series. Deception contains several new features in the series, such as chess and puzzle games with the MK characters and an online mode. The Konquest Mode returns from Deadly Alliance, but follows the life of Shujinko, a warrior who is deceived by Onaga to search for artifacts to give Onaga more powers. In November 2006, Midway released Mortal Kombat: Unchained, a port for the PlayStation Portable, which adds characters to the game from the previous title.\nSeries co-creator Ed Boon designed Deception to be an unpredictable fighting game, and included new features such as the minigames as surprises. Several parts from Deadly Alliance such as combos and arenas were redesigned to be more realistic as well as more interactive. Deception has been well received by video game reviewers, who praised the fights and the new features. The Konquest Mode, however, received criticism for poor voice acting. Several publications have called Deception the best fighting game of 2004.",

NASCAR 2005 is the first game in the series to drop the word Thunder from the title since NASCAR 2001.

This was the first NASCAR edition to be released exclusively on six generation home consoles.\nUnlike previous entries, which would normally add a few extra features but leave most of the game identical to its predecessor, the game brought massive change to the series. One example is the inclusion of NASCAR series other than the NASCAR Cup Series; the Busch Series (renamed the National Series to avoid an M rating from the ESRB for alcohol advertising, though the series is still referred to in-game as the Busch Series by the player's agent and Bill Weber), the Craftsman Truck Series, and the Featherlite Modified Series, plus production cars and the Daytona Prototypes of the Rolex Sports Car Series. More examples include the implementation of NASCAR's new Chase for the Cup points system, and Fight to the Top mode, where the player controls a custom driver throughout his career starting in the lower series and working up the ladder (similar to NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona). Another change is the absence of the cockpit view and the absence of makes and models in the Truck series, all of which appear to be Ford F-150s.

Legacy mode is when you completely take over a team, control its recruiting classes, and remain a \"Division 1\" powerhouse.

It was released on September 25, 2003, for the PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, and Xbox. Unlike the previous titles in the series, this game has 5-on-5 gameplay instead of the usual 3-on-3 gameplay with the earlier titles. Despite that fact, however, the game does not include penalty shots, and it is still an arcade-type hockey game like its predecessors. It also has, as the name suggests, a lot of hard hitting, appealing more often to casual hockey fans than hardcore ones. The cover athlete of the game is Nicklas Lidström, and features commentary from Tim Kitzrow and Harry Teinowitz.\nUnlike many other hockey video games of the 21st century, NHL Hitz Pro had the IIHF license, enabling it to use the jerseys of the Olympic hockey teams.\nThe game also has many game modes, one of the most popular being the \"Pick-Up Hockey\" game mode, where the game would turn into either a roller, street, or pond hockey match-up between two amateur teams.",

The Thousand-Year Door is the second Paper Mario game.\nThe Thousand-Year Door borrows many gameplay elements from its predecessor, such as a paper-themed universe and a turn-based battle system with an emphasis on action. For the majority of the game the player controls Mario, although Bowser and Princess Peach are playable at certain points. The plot follows Mario's quest as he tries to retrieve the seven Crystal Stars and rescue Peach from the X-Nauts.\nThe game was well received by critics, attaining an average score of 88 percent from GameRankings. Critics generally praised the game's engaging plot and gameplay, but criticised it for not being a big progression from its predecessor. The Thousand-Year Door won the \"Role Playing Game of the Year\" award at the 2005 Interactive Achievement Awards.",

      "description": "Resident Evil 4 is a third-person shooter game developed by Capcom Production Studio 4 and published by Capcom. The sixth major installment in the Resident Evil series, it was originally released for the GameCube in 2005. Players control U.S. government special agent Leon S. Kennedy, who is sent on a mission to rescue the U.S. president's daughter Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped by a cult. In a rural part of Europe, Leon fights hordes of villagers infected by a mind-controlling parasite, and reunites with the spy Ada Wong.\nDevelopment began for PlayStation 2 in 1999. Four proposed versions were discarded; the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami. In a departure from the fixed camera angles and slower survival horror gameplay of previous instalments, the team focused on developing more dynamic shooting action.\nResident Evil 4 was announced as a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but was ported to numerous formats, becoming a cross-platform hit, selling over 10 million copies across all platforms. It garnered acclaim for its narrative, gameplay, voice acting, and characters, and is often named one of the best video games, winning multiple Game of the Year awards in 2005. It influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres, popularizing the \"over-the-shoulder\" third-person view. Resident Evil 5 was released in 2009.\n\n#Gameplay\nThe player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series' previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.\nResident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a \"finishing move\" on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game's many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.\nThe main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (\"The Cattle\" in Spanish). Los Ganados can dodge, wield melee and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other.\nThe inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.\nCapcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is \"Separate Ways\", a minigame which focuses on Ada Wong's involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series' villain Albert Wesker. \"Ada's Report\", a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada's relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot. Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigames \"The Mercenaries\" and \"Assignment Ada\" (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new weapons, and a cutscene browser.\n\n#Plot\nU.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President's daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult. He travels to a nameless rural village in Spain, where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.\nWhile in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas. He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former Los Illuminados researcher. The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her.

Departing significantly from the series&#39; previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.<br />\nResident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a &quot;finishing move&quot; on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game&#39;s many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.<br />\nThe main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (&quot;The Cattle&quot; in Spanish). Los Ganados can dodge, wield melee and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other.<br />\nThe inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.<br />\nCapcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases.

He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.\nAfterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping. Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary's intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser's fatal defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada's help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island explodes.",
      "description_html": "<p>Resident Evil 4 is a third-person shooter game developed by Capcom Production Studio 4 and published by Capcom. The sixth major installment in the Resident Evil series, it was originally released for the GameCube in 2005. Players control U.S. government special agent Leon S. Kennedy, who is sent on a mission to rescue the U.S. president&#39;s daughter Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped by a cult. In a rural part of Europe, Leon fights hordes of villagers infected by a mind-controlling parasite, and reunites with the spy Ada Wong.<br />\nDevelopment began for PlayStation 2 in 1999. Four proposed versions were discarded; the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami. In a departure from the fixed camera angles and slower survival horror gameplay of previous instalments, the team focused on developing more dynamic shooting action.<br />\nResident Evil 4 was announced as a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but was ported to numerous formats, becoming a cross-platform hit, selling over 10 million copies across all platforms. It garnered acclaim for its narrative, gameplay, voice acting, and characters, and is often named one of the best video games, winning multiple Game of the Year awards in 2005. It influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres, popularizing the &quot;over-the-shoulder&quot; third-person view. Resident Evil 5 was released in 2009.</p>\n<h1>Gameplay</h1>\n<p>The player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series&#39; previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.<br />\nResident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a &quot;finishing move&quot; on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game&#39;s many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.<br />\nThe main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (&quot;The Cattle&quot; in Spanish). Los Ganados can dodge, wield melee and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other.<br />\nThe inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.<br />\nCapcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is &quot;Separate Ways&quot;, a minigame which focuses on Ada Wong&#39;s involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series&#39; villain Albert Wesker. &quot;Ada&#39;s Report&quot;, a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada&#39;s relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot. Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigames &quot;The Mercenaries&quot; and &quot;Assignment Ada&quot; (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new weapons, and a cutscene browser.</p>\n<h1>Plot</h1>\n<p>U.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President&#39;s daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult. He travels to a nameless rural village in Spain, where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.<br />\nWhile in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas. He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former Los Illuminados researcher. The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her. They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of Los Illuminados, reveals his plan to use the plaga they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a &quot;sample&quot; once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.<br />\nAfter killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Illuminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler&#39;s henchmen who owns the castle, and the two become separated by Salazar&#39;s traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley&#39;s infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon&#39;s hands. While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.<br />\nAfterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping. Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary&#39;s intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser&#39;s fatal defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada&#39;s help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island explodes.</p>",

      "description": "Resident Evil Zero, known in Japan as Biohazard Zero, is a survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. It is the fifth major installment in the Resident Evil series and was originally released for the Nintendo GameCube in 2002. It is a prequel to Resident Evil (2002), covering the ordeals experienced in the Arklay Mountains by the special police force, S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team. The story follows officer Rebecca Chambers and convicted criminal Billy Coen as they explore an abandoned training facility for employees of the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. The gameplay is similar to early Resident Evil games, but includes a unique \"partner zapping\" system. The player controls both Rebecca and Billy, switching control between them to solve puzzles and use their unique abilities.\nDevelopment for Resident Evil Zero began on the Nintendo 64 in 1998. The partner system was created to take advantage of the short load times possible with the capabilities of the N64 Game Pak. The cartridge format also provided limitations, as the storage capacity was significantly less than that of a CD-ROM. The team had to approach the design differently from previous series entries to conserve storage space. Resident Evil Zero was designed to be more difficult than previous Resident Evil games. Inspired by Sweet Home (1989), the team removed the item storage boxes present in earlier games and introduced a new item-dropping feature. Development slowed when the team encountered memory storage problems, and so production was moved to the newly announced GameCube. The game had to be rebuilt, with only the concept and story carried over.\nResident Evil Zero received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the graphics and audio for building a haunting atmosphere. Opinions on the new partner and item systems were mixed. Some found the changes were an improvement and added new layers of strategy; others believed the changes were cumbersome or non-innovative. The controls were panned as outdated and Capcom was criticized for not evolving the series' tank controls. The game was ported to the Wii in 2008, and a high-definition remaster was released in January 2016. These re-releases received mixed reviews due to lack of improvements made to the original. Resident Evil Zero is commercially successful, having sold over 2.5 million copies across all platforms.",

Most levels have three possible missions—\"Hero,\" \"Dark,\" or \"Normal\"—that the player may choose to complete, while some have only two of the three. The missions completed determine the game's plot and subsequently playable levels, a feature referenced by the game's tagline. The plot centers on the attempt of Shadow, a creation of Doctor Eggman's grandfather, Professor Gerald Robotnik, to learn about his past while suffering from amnesia. To defeat enemies, Shadow can use various weapons and special attacks.\nShadow the Hedgehog received generally unfavorable reviews from critics. The game was criticized for its controls and dark themes, especially the addition of guns and other weapons to traditional Sonic gameplay. However, some reviewers praised its replay value.

The emulated games span multiple genres and consoles—from the Sega Genesis to the Sega Saturn—and retain the features of their original releases with minimal edits. Player progress is rewarded with unlockable demos of well-known Sonic games, videos, and promotional artwork spanning the history of the Sonic franchise.\nThe compilation was conceived by developer Sonic Team to introduce younger players to older games in the Sonic franchise. While its predecessor, Sonic Mega Collection, surrounds the series' most popular installments, Sonic Gems Collection has a greater focus on titles considered rare and obscure, such as Sonic CD and Sonic the Fighters. Sonic Team prioritized games they considered high quality; desired titles such as SegaSonic the Hedgehog and Nights into Dreams were excluded due to emulation difficulties.\nSonic Gems Collection was released for the GameCube and PlayStation 2. Its reviews were mixed or average; critics were sharply divided over whether or not the package would leave players satisfied. Among its games, reviewers preferred Sonic CD and Vectorman, but found Sonic the Fighters and Sonic R mediocre, and disliked the Game Gear games. Some reviewers were disappointed by the absence of the Streets of Rage titles in the North American version due to problems with the Entertainment Software Rating Board and other Sonic games like Knuckles' Chaotix and Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure. The GameCube version was branded as a Player's Choice title in 2006.",

The player must reach the goal without falling off or letting the timer reach zero to advance to the next stage. There are also several multiplayer modes: independent minigames as well as extensions of the main single-player game.\nSuper Monkey Ball received highly positive reviews from critics, who praised the simplicity and subtle depth of its control scheme as well as the new multiplayer modes not present in its arcade counterpart, although some felt its presentation was lacking.

It is the second game in the Super Smash Bros. series, following the 1999 release of the original game. It was released in Japan and North America in 2001, and in Europe and Australia in 2002.\nThe game features characters from Nintendo video game franchises such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, and Pokémon.
