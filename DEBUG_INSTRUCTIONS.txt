ZERO-SETUP AUTOMATIC DEBUG
===========================

The launcher automatically sends debug data to me. You do NOTHING!

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------

1. Copy EmuBuddyLauncher-linux to your Steam Deck

2. Launch it in Game Mode

3. When disclaimer appears, press this sequence:
   - A, X, Y, B
   - Left stick: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT
   - Right stick: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT
   - LB, RB, LT, RT

4. Press A to accept disclaimer

5. You'll see: "Debug Data Sent - No action needed"

6. That's it! I can now check the shared database and see your button data.

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
- All button presses are recorded while disclaimer is shown
- When you press A, data uploads to kvdb.io (shared database)
- I check https://kvdb.io/2Z8jQqFjkGN4HnV3oCbqxC/ periodically
- Your data appears with timestamp

You don't need to send me anything or do any setup!
