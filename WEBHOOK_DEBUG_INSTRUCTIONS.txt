WEBHOOK DEBUGGING FOR STEAM DECK
=================================

This will let me see exactly what controller buttons are being pressed on your Steam Deck.

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------

1. On your PC, go to: https://webhook.site
   - You'll get a unique URL like: https://webhook.site/YOUR-UNIQUE-ID

2. Copy that FULL URL

3. On Steam Deck, create a file called: debug_webhook.txt
   - Put it in the same folder as EmuBuddyLauncher-linux
   - Paste your webhook URL into this file (just the URL, nothing else)
   - Save the file

4. Launch EmuBuddyLauncher-linux

5. When the disclaimer appears, press this EXACT sequence:
   - A button
   - X button
   - Y button
   - B button
   - Left stick UP
   - Left stick DOWN
   - Left stick LEFT
   - Left stick RIGHT
   - Right stick UP
   - Right stick DOWN
   - Right stick LEFT
   - Right stick RIGHT
   - LB (Left Bumper)
   - RB (Right Bumper)
   - LT (Left Trigger)
   - RT (Right Trigger)

6. Go back to webhook.site on your PC
   - You'll see all the button press data
   - Copy ALL the data and send it to me

7. Then press A to accept the disclaimer and continue

WHAT THIS DOES:
---------------
- Every button press sends data to webhook.site showing the raw button codes
- I can see exactly what values your Steam Deck controller sends
- This will help me fix the A/B button issue

FILE LOCATIONS:
--------------
EmuBuddyLauncher-linux  <- The launcher
debug_webhook.txt       <- Create this with your webhook URL
launcher_debug.log      <- Local log file (also useful)
