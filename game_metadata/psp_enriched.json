      "description": "James Bond 007: From Russia with Love is a third-person shooter video game developed by EA Redwood Shores and published by Electronic Arts featuring Ian Fleming's secret agent, James Bond, whose likeness and voice is that of Sean Connery. The game is based on the 1957 novel and the film of the same name. The game follows the storyline of the book and film, with adding in new scenes to make the game more action-oriented, as well as changing the affiliation of the main villains. Additionally, it features many elements of later Bond films to recreate the feel of the era such as the Aston Martin DB5 that debuted in Goldfinger (1964) and the jet pack from Thunderball (1965). From Russia with Love is also notable in that it is the first video game to use Sean Connery's younger likeness as James Bond and the first to include all new voice work by the actor after twenty-two years away from the role. From Russia with Love is the last James Bond video game EA Games marketed before they lost the rights to Activision in 2006.",

      "description": "James Bond 007: From Russia with Love is a third-person shooter video game developed by EA Redwood Shores and published by Electronic Arts featuring Ian Fleming's secret agent, James Bond, whose likeness and voice is that of Sean Connery. The game is based on the 1957 novel and the film of the same name. The game follows the storyline of the book and film, with adding in new scenes to make the game more action-oriented, as well as changing the affiliation of the main villains. Additionally, it features many elements of later Bond films to recreate the feel of the era such as the Aston Martin DB5 that debuted in Goldfinger (1964) and the jet pack from Thunderball (1965). From Russia with Love is also notable in that it is the first video game to use Sean Connery's younger likeness as James Bond and the first to include all new voice work by the actor after twenty-two years away from the role. From Russia with Love is the last James Bond video game EA Games marketed before they lost the rights to Activision in 2006.",

In Cabela's® North American Adventures your search for trophy game is captured on film as an expert cameraman records your adventures. It’s hunting taken to the extreme with record-class opportunities in situations meant only for the pros. To make the hunt even more challenging, you not only have to wait for the right gun or bow shot opportunity; you must make sure the cameraman perfectly frames the action. You’ll hunt more than 30 game species across ten North American regions from Alaska to Mexico. Use cover and stealth to close the distance on elusive trophies, and expert duck calling in an action-packed mallard hunt. When your trophy’s down, relive the moment by watching an exciting video of the hunt’s highlights. Also featured are arcade-style shooting galleries and a Big Trophy Tournament where your persistence and skill as a hunter can help you bring down record-sized racks.\n©2010 Activision Publishing, Inc.\nActivision is a registered trademark of Activision Publishing, Inc.

      "description": "Dead to Rights: Reckoning returns to crime-infested Grant City, as an important informant is kidnapped on the eve of the investigation of a major crime lord. Anticipating the worst if the crime boss is not brought to justice, Jack Slate and his K-9 companion Shadow thrust themselves into hostile gang territory to save the informant and bring peace to the City. Dead to Rights: Reckoning expands upon the blistering action of the series with a robust ranged and melee fighting system that allows Jack to spit lead and bust heads with ease, and an all-new selection of weapons and lethal disarms. Players will also have unprecedented control of Shadow, utilizing him to watch Jack's back and unleash savage canine fury on lowlife thugs. For the first time in the series Dead to Rights: Reckoning allows players to go head to head through wireless multiplayer death matches, adding hours of replay value to an already extensive single player campaign.",

      "description": "Frantic and fun, Fat Princess pits two hordes of players against each other in comic medieval battle royale. The player's goal is to rescue a beloved princess from the enemy castle. There is a catch, though; the adversary has been feeding her with the cake that grows in a nearby forest to make her heavier to carry. Therefore, it's going to take most of your army working together to carry her back across the battlefield. Luckily, Fat Princess supports up to 32 players online simultaneously so plenty of help is available. Team balance and strategy is crucial in Fat Princess, one of the PlayStation Network's most anticipated titles ever, as players can switch between five different character classes literally at the drop of a hat. The name of the game is cooperation, whether it's flinging another player over the enemy's walls with a teeterboard, healing him while he charges into battle, or adding your muscle to carry the princess faster.",

      "description": "The first hi-res 2D fighter from the creators of the Guilty Gear series! BlazBlue is a traditional 2D fighter where two characters participate in a duel. The story of the game involves dissent and destruction among a powerful council, known unofficially as \"the Library,\" which controls a great power that once saved humanity, but which now wields its power in protective, some say repressive, ways.\nA round is called a \"rebel\" and one match can consist of one to five \"rebels\".

Play as Cecilia, a cleric, or as Levant, a knight. Enjoy an extraordinary level of polish providing quick, fun battles, flexible strategy, and virtually no load times with an option that allows you to install the UMD™ game onto a Memory Stick Duo™. Approximately 20 minutes of anime movie cutscenes beautifully highlight the epic story.\nLong ago, Norvia, Goddess of Creation, used the Holy Vessel, a divine chalice charged with all Force to create life and the Divinities. Then, Delgaia, God of Destruction, brought about a calamity, intending to return all Force to the Holy Vessel and Berge to the void. The Divinities sacrificed themselves to seal Delgaia deep within the earth. As Berge lay in ruin, Norvia made a covenant to restore it on one condition. When the Hour of Judgment came to pass, the world would have to decide its path: creation or destruction.\n©2010 ATLUS Developed by Sting\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation®Network Terms of Service and User Agreement.

Play as Cecilia, a cleric, or as Levant, a knight. Enjoy an extraordinary level of polish providing quick, fun battles, flexible strategy, and virtually no load times with an option that allows you to install the UMD™ game onto a Memory Stick Duo™. Approximately 20 minutes of anime movie cutscenes beautifully highlight the epic story.<br />\nLong ago, Norvia, Goddess of Creation, used the Holy Vessel, a divine chalice charged with all Force to create life and the Divinities. Then, Delgaia, God of Destruction, brought about a calamity, intending to return all Force to the Holy Vessel and Berge to the void. The Divinities sacrificed themselves to seal Delgaia deep within the earth. As Berge lay in ruin, Norvia made a covenant to restore it on one condition. When the Hour of Judgment came to pass, the world would have to decide its path: creation or destruction.<br />\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation®Network Terms of Service and User Agreement.

(ロックマン3 Dr.ワイリーの最期!?, \"Rockman 3: The End of Dr. Wily!?\") in Japan and Mega Man III in game, is an action-platform video game developed and published by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the third game of the original Mega Man series and was originally released in Japan on September 28, 1990. The game localized in North America later in 1990 and in European regions in 1992. Taking place after the events of Mega Man 2, the plot follows the titular hero as he helps his creator, Dr. Light, and a former villain, Dr. Wily, collect parts for a peace-keeping robot by defeating several Robot Masters that have gone haywire.\nA platform-action game, Mega Man 3 follows the same format set forth by its two predecessors. The player, as Mega Man, must complete a series of stages in any order. Defeating a stage's boss will earn the player its special weapon, which can be selected and used at will throughout the rest of the game. Mega Man 3 introduces new gameplay elements such as Mega Man's canine sidekick Rush and the ability to slide along the ground. Unlike with the first two installments of the series, artist and designer Keiji Inafune has considered the creation of Mega Man 3 to be very stressful due to time constraints and his own increased responsibilities during its development.\nFollowing the success of Mega Man 2 released two years earlier, Mega Man 3 has sold 1.17 million copies and has been positively received in critical reviews. Its presentation and gameplay has been especially praised, although many sources found the game to be too difficult. Like other titles in the series, Mega Man 3 has been re-released several times on other gaming platforms, on mobile phones, and as part of various Mega Man franchise compilations.",

Defeating a stage's boss will earn the player its special weapon, which can be selected and used at will throughout the rest of the game.

However, Shift automatically adjusts the difficulty depending on the player's experience and skills. Before the player enters the career, he or she has to complete a test drive at the famous Brands Hatch track to familiarize the game with his or her driving abilities. \n\n###Cars\nNeed for Speed: Shift offers a roster of more than 60 vehicles. As in most Need for Speed games, the player starts with a small amount of money and only a handful of available vehicles. To unlock and purchase better cars, the player has to win races. The cars in Need for Speed: Shift consists of four classes called \"tiers\". The lowest tier contains the cheapest and slowest cars, while supercars from manufacturers like Lamborghini and Bugatti belong to the higher tiers. \n\nThe game also has a detailed modification system. The player can customize not only the car's look but also its important details like tires and aerodynamics.\n\n###Tracks\nAs the player progresses, he or she may unlock new levels. Some of them are based on real-life tracks of Formula One fame, including Spa-Francorchamps, Nurburgring, Silverstone and Laguna Seca. Others are purely fictional and only exist in-game.",

      "description": "The PSP version of \"Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands\" is a side-scrolling 2.5D platformer that roughly follows the same style as the other versions. It has a different storyline involving freeing the Sisters of Time, a different setting and antagonist.\n\nThe game features a plot in which the prophecy is written that a member of Prince's royal family will bring an end to an evil fire spirit Ahihud's dark reign over hidden mystic land. To ensure his survival, the evil spirit's minions hunt down those with the royal blood of Persia. Prince escapes his tower, where he is kept protected by his father, and pursues a mysterious guiding light, which turns out to be Helem, a spirit of Time who promises to help the Prince defeat his enemy. Together, they journey to a mysterious, hidden kingdom which is revealed to be the holy site where the first god came to create universe. The kingdom is fully under control of Ahihud, who aims to devour the land's magical energy, the Elixir. The player has to confront Ahihud's sand monsters, collects Elixir to boost his own strength and vitality, and find portals to spirits realm, where Helem's sisters are to be freed. Each freed Sister of Time grants Prince a new ability to control time, like freezing a selected spot or creature, or hasting it. After making his way through the mystic land, Prince defeats Ahihud's two most powerful servants, the gigantic guardian of the palace and the sand assassin, who was created to hunt down Prince's relatives. In the end, Prince is able to kill Ahihud in his own domain in spirits realm, fulfilling the prophecy and restoring the mystic land to its former glory.",

The game was first released in Japan in 1996 and was later released in North America and Europe in 1997. The game was ported to the PlayStation Portable in 2006. A remastered version of the original PlayStation game was released for PlayStation 4 in 2017 for the game&#39;s twentieth anniversary.<br />\nThe game spawned two follow-up titles; a guitar-based spin-off titled Um Jammer Lammy, released in 1999 for the PlayStation, and a direct sequel, PaRappa the Rapper 2, released for the PlayStation 2 in 2001. An anime television series based on the games aired in Japan between April 2001 and January 2002, with a short spin-off series airing from October 2016.</p>",

(ロックマン3 Dr.ワイリーの最期!?, \"Rockman 3: The End of Dr. Wily!?\") in Japan and Mega Man III in game, is an action-platform video game developed and published by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the third game of the original Mega Man series and was originally released in Japan on September 28, 1990. The game localized in North America later in 1990 and in European regions in 1992. Taking place after the events of Mega Man 2, the plot follows the titular hero as he helps his creator, Dr. Light, and a former villain, Dr. Wily, collect parts for a peace-keeping robot by defeating several Robot Masters that have gone haywire.\nA platform-action game, Mega Man 3 follows the same format set forth by its two predecessors. The player, as Mega Man, must complete a series of stages in any order. Defeating a stage's boss will earn the player its special weapon, which can be selected and used at will throughout the rest of the game. Mega Man 3 introduces new gameplay elements such as Mega Man's canine sidekick Rush and the ability to slide along the ground. Unlike with the first two installments of the series, artist and designer Keiji Inafune has considered the creation of Mega Man 3 to be very stressful due to time constraints and his own increased responsibilities during its development.\nFollowing the success of Mega Man 2 released two years earlier, Mega Man 3 has sold 1.17 million copies and has been positively received in critical reviews. Its presentation and gameplay has been especially praised, although many sources found the game to be too difficult. Like other titles in the series, Mega Man 3 has been re-released several times on other gaming platforms, on mobile phones, and as part of various Mega Man franchise compilations.",

The game was re-released in 2011 for the PlayStation Portable. The original version was not localized for western territories, however the PSP version was released in North America and Europe under the title Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 2: Innocent Sin.\nInnocent Sin takes place in the fictional Sumaru City, focusing on a group of high school students from Seven Sisters High School. The protagonist, Tatsuya Suou, and a group of friends must confront a villainous figure called the Joker, who is causing the spread of reality-warping rumors through the city. The group are aided in their quest by their Personas, personified aspects of their personalities. The gameplay features turn-based battle gameplay, where characters use their Personas in battle against demons, and a separate Rumor system, where rumors spread around the city can influence events in the characters' favor.\nDevelopment on Innocent Sin began after the release of the original Persona, and retained most of the original's staff. The game carried over the story themes and basic gameplay mechanics of Persona, while changing and improving on some of the mechanics. The characters were designed by Kazuma Kaneko and Shigenori Soejima. The original release was not localized due to staff shortages and concerns over its content. Reception to the game was generally positive for its original release, but reviews were more mixed for its remake due to its age. A direct sequel to Innocent Sin, Persona 2: Eternal Punishment, was released in 2000 in Japan and North America.",

      "description": "Sid Meier’s Pirates is an action-adventure strategy game, a remake of 1987 game of the same name. It’s set in an open world around the Caribbean islands. The game features numerous activities, including sailing and exploration, ship battles, trading and diplomacy.\n\nThe core gameplay of the game is sailing among the islands, cities and colonies.

The game follows the storyline of the book and film, with adding in new scenes to make the game more action-oriented, as well as changing the affiliation of the main villains. Additionally, it features many elements of later Bond films to recreate the feel of the era such as the Aston Martin DB5 that debuted in Goldfinger (1964) and the jet pack from Thunderball (1965). From Russia with Love is also notable in that it is the first video game to use Sean Connery's younger likeness as James Bond and the first to include all new voice work by the actor after twenty-two years away from the role. From Russia with Love is the last James Bond video game EA Games marketed before they lost the rights to Activision in 2006.",

It was released on December 22, 1999 in Japan and on August 29, 2000 in North America. Inspired by Norse mythology, Valkyrie Profile follows the titular valkyrie, Lenneth, as she travels through Midgard, collecting the souls of slain heroes to serve either as einherjar or her personal companions for Ragnarok - the battle to decide the fate of all creation - and trains them by fighting monsters and performing additional quests. As she journeys, she learns more about her original human life, removed from her memory upon becoming a Valkyrie.\nThe game was both a commercial and critical success; it sold over 700,000 copies, and critics praised the deep and complicated gameplay system and the plot. Valkyrie Profile sparked an enhanced port of the game, which was released for the PlayStation Portable in 2006 under the name Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth. It also led to two other games in the Valkyrie Profile series: a 2006 PlayStation 2 prequel, titled Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria, released in 2006 in Japan and North America and 2007 in Europe, and another prequel titled Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume, released for the Nintendo DS in Japan in 2008, March 17, 2009 in North America and on April 3, 2009 in all PAL regions.",

Forced to rearm and retrain from scratch – and to prove his worth to this new country’s somewhat xenophobic populace – Adol takes up a king’s quest to explore a nearby set of ruins, only to find himself embroiled in a high-stakes game of appeasing ancient dragons and saving the world… yet again.\nAlong the way, he’ll meet a variety of companions old and new who will join him in his quest via the newly introduced party system, wherein up to three characters may be controlled at any one time. Only by mastering the use of pierce, slash, and thrust attacks, as well as dozens of unique skills, quick dodging, “flash guarding,” and more can Adol and his team uncover the mystery of the Five Great Dragons, the five ancient tribes of Altago, and the recent string of earthquakes that threaten to tear apart this ancient and storied land.\nCome take part in the first Ys adventure of the modern era! The frenetic challenges and massive bosses that made this historic series famous are back, and they’re bigger than ever.\nMake SEVEN your lucky number!Key Features:\nFast, real-time combat with dozens of unique abilities, both physical and magical\nA brand new party system allowing for up to three playable characters at once, including Adol’s loyal sidekick Dogi and fan-favorite mercenary Geis from Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim\nEnormous screen-filling bosses set to quintessentially Ys rock music composed by the legendary Falcom Sound Team jdk\nOne of the most complex and involving storylines of the entire series, spanning well over 20 hours’ worth of gameplay\nUpscaled HD graphics and consistent 60 fps framerate bring this former PSP-exclusive title up to modern PC standards\nFull Steamworks integration, including a bevy of new achievements",
