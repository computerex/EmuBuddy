The game was released in Japan on November 21, 1990, in North America in August 1991, and in Europe in 1992. F-Zero is the first game of the F-Zero series, and was one of the two launch titles (along with Super Mario World) for the SNES in Japan; but was accompanied by additional initial titles in North America and Europe. It was re-released for the Virtual Console service on the Wii in late 2006, the Wii U in early 2013, and on the New Nintendo 3DS in early 2016. Nintendo re-released F-Zero in the United States in September 2017 as part of the company's Super NES Classic Edition.\nThe game takes place in the year 2560, where multi-billionaires with lethargic lifestyles created a new form of entertainment based on the Formula One races called \"F-Zero\". The player can choose between one of four characters in the game, each with their respective hovercar. The player then can race against computer-controlled characters in fifteen tracks divided into three leagues.\nF-Zero has been acknowledged by critics as one of the greatest video games of all time as well for setting the standard for the racing genre and the creation of its futuristic subgenre. Critics lauded F-Zero for its fast and challenging gameplay, variety of tracks, and extensive use of the graphical mode called \"Mode 7\". This graphics-rendering technique was an innovative technological achievement at the time that made racing games more realistic, the first of which was F-Zero. As a result, IGN credited it for reinvigorating the genre and inspiring the future creation of numerous racing games.

Players will explore five stylized worlds and experience up to 10 hours of epic adventure saving Pip’s village from the evil Queen DeRezzia.<br/> <br/>Inspired by classic platformers, Adventures of Pip basks in a world where players can defeat a huge 32-bit boss as a single pixel or even as an 8-bit character.<br/> <br/>With three different forms, evolve and devolve Pip to solve puzzles and defeat enemies; each with their own weakness and strength that must be unraveled throughout the campaign.<br/><br/><strong>STORY</strong><br/>The Bit Stream is the life force that fuels Pixel Kingdom. The One who taps its power can forge the Kingdom's destiny.<br/><br/>Pip is only one pixel in a world full of 32-bit characters, yet he is the only one brave enough to face the Queen DeRezzia and rescue the kidnapped princess. <br/><br/>Moved by his plight, the ghost knight, Sir Elwyn, bestowed upon Pip the power to harness the Bit Stream. With the ability to absorb his enemy’s pixels, Pip can transform into a hi-fidelity hero! But be aware! With each evolution not only will you gain skills but some will be lost.",

If you're lucky, you'll hit the enemy's HQ which will end in you wining the game.<br/>Build an R&amp;D facility to upgrade your rockets or defense systems. Inflict more damage and widen the range of explosion causing closeby units to take damage as well.<h3>Defend</h3><br/>Place energy pillars to create a forcefield giving you additional protection against enemy rockets. Develop a satelite defense systems that will have chance to shoot down enemy rockets while they are still in the air.",

In a once-peaceful galaxy, invading Darkbot forces are cruelly capturing small, blue critters. Flying from planet to planet, help Armillo rescue them and take back his home: a series of spherical 3D worlds featuring all manner of obstacles and enemies. Your main weapon against the Darkbots is Armillo’s roll, which lets you navigate paths, dodging or wrecking anything in your way. Jump and boost your roll to destroy tougher enemies, or collect power-ups to gain special abilities. Along the way, solve cheeky puzzles and grab orbs, which you can spend on bolstering Armillo’s powers for improved Darkbot routing. And that’s something you’ll need, as you battle multi-stage bosses in their own worlds. Within every level, track down a hidden Parallel World, where you’ll be challenged to speed run through a 2D zone. You’ll need lightning reflexes and your best, old-school platforming skills in these special stages – especially as you’re pushed to beat each stage against the clock!

The players have to be careful with their decisions as the sleepwalker can just walk off the level. Several entities can also prevent the sleepwalker from arriving at his destination.

Problems with the game&#39;s PAL conversion prevented it from being released in Europe and Australia for many years; it was finally released for the Virtual Console in those regions in the form of an import from North America on July 24, 2009 for the Wii and on July 25, 2013 for the Wii U. The game was re-released on the Virtual Console in North America on January 5, 2009 for the Wii and on May 8, 2013 for the Wii U and in Japan on April 28, 2009 for the Wii and on May 8, 2013 for the Wii U. It was also included along with 5 other Kirby games in the Wii collection for Kirby&#39;s 20th anniversary, Kirby&#39;s Dream Collection.</p>",

From the creators of RollerCoaster Tycoon® 3 and LostWinds® comes a rollercoaster game unlike any other, starring little old ladies, mad scientists, the undead, accountants, queasy guys, extra-terrestrial visitors, and …er… sheep.\nSimply trace your finger over the touchscreen to build and tweak any coaster you can imagine, in glorious 3D. It's so easy to do that anyone can build them, ride them, crash them - tall, short, long and fast; modern, wooden & crazy. The physics simulation is easy and fun to use, yet rewards each bit of care put into improving your coasters with ever higher scores.\nCoaster Crazy Deluxe takes you on a journey around the world (and to the moon) to build a cash-making coaster empire with ever-more insane creations. Unlock more special pieces, coaster cars and track types that let you earn even more cash, and meet the fiendish challenges posed by the Crazy characters in the game.\nThey are demanding customers:\n- Can you make your coaster fast enough to get the speed freak surfing with delight?\n- Can you keep G-forces low enough to  prevent the Professor’s Nitro Glycerin from exploding?\n- Can you beat a coaster score before the zombie starts infecting other passengers?\n- Can you do that all at the same time?\n- And what will happen to the little old lady if your ride is too intense?\n- And then there’s the Mayor.  Alien. King. Policeman. Queasy guy. Accountant. And sheep..\nThread your coasters through themed scenery and design custom paint-jobs to create the ride of a lifetime – and then upload to share with your friends and the world! See how your creations stack up on the Coaster Crazy global leaderboards, and earn achievements. When yours are downloaded by others, you’ll earn in-game currency.\nOr you could just mess around to your heart’s content in the coaster-building ‘sandbox’.\nNo sheep were harmed in the making of this game. But the queasy guy really wasn’t happy.\nCoaster Crazy Deluxe is a paid-for game (no in-app purchases) that offers all-new challenges and two exclusive additional world levels (Cruise Ship and West Coast America) compared to the free-to-play Coaster Crazy game.",

The physics simulation is easy and fun to use, yet rewards each bit of care put into improving your coasters with ever higher scores. <br/><br/>Coaster Crazy Deluxe takes you on a journey around the world (and to the moon) to build a cash-making coaster empire with ever-more insane creations. Unlock more special pieces, coaster cars and track types that let you earn even more cash, and meet the fiendish challenges posed by the Crazy characters in the game.<br/><br/>They are demanding customers: <br/>- Can you make your coaster fast enough to get the speed freak surfing with delight? <br/>- Can you keep G-forces low enough to  prevent the Professor’s Nitro Glycerin from exploding?  <br/>- Can you beat a coaster score before the zombie starts infecting other passengers? <br/>- Can you do that all at the same time? <br/>- And what will happen to the little old lady if your ride is too intense? <br/>- And then there’s the Mayor.  Alien. King. Policeman. Queasy guy. Accountant. And sheep.. <br/><br/>Thread your coasters through themed scenery and design custom paint-jobs to create the ride of a lifetime – and then upload to share with your friends and the world! See how your creations stack up on the Coaster Crazy global leaderboards, and earn achievements. When yours are downloaded by others, you’ll earn in-game currency. <br/><br/>Or you could just mess around to your heart’s content in the coaster-building ‘sandbox’. <br/><br/>No sheep were harmed in the making of this game. But the queasy guy really wasn’t happy. <br/><br/>Coaster Crazy Deluxe is a paid-for game (no in-app purchases) that offers all-new challenges and two exclusive additional world levels (Cruise Ship and West Coast America) compared to the free-to-play Coaster Crazy game.",

      "description": "Electronic Super Joy is a platform video game with a humorous tone and numerous levels followed by electronic music. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe player performs for a black human-like character. He has to cross through the levels, looking for his stolen butt and seeking revenge for it. The player's goal is to get through every level and survive after enemies' attacks. As time passes, the game sets three boss fights. \n\n###Key features\nThe world is drenched in electronic music; its track supports each level. There are more than 45 levels with different obstructions, enemies, and surroundings.\nThe player passes plenty of checkpoints on each level; it is possible to resume from there if they die. Every stage is covered in a particular color; some of them have portals, bridges, flying stairs, mazes, plants; some surfaces block the player's movement, or affect him otherwise. There are also moving levels that force the protagonist to move quicker. The character can run, jump and do the “smashing” movement - he then drops upon something directly. At some levels, the player can also fly or double jump. Some of the enemies perform as small white shooting missiles, some of them are black human-like creatures who somehow differ from the protagonist: for example, they might wear a hat. An enemy usually yelps a nasty black-humored phrase like “I stole your butt, it's true!”",

However, instead of discovering paradise, the inhabitants of The Infinity unlocked the door to a long forgotten nightmare.\nDeep inside this leviathan something terrible hunts, out of myth and legend the last werewolf stalks the ship. Infinity Runner centres on a prisoner desperately trying to escape the decaying ship and the clutches of the terror within. It’s a sci-fi action running game for PC, Mac, and Linux that features 14 action packed levels, Oculus Rift DK1 & DK2 (Runtime 4.4) support and online multi-player.\nIn Infinity Runner, the player controls the protagonist, the prisoner, from a first-person perspective as he is challenged to escape from the gargantuan spaceship. This is accomplished by use of techniques and movements inspired by the disciplines of parkour and mixed martial arts, the game-play conveys the players strain and physical contact with the environment whilst dealing with the constantly changing and expansive surroundings. As well as these evasive elements there’s also combat sections in the game where a dynamic targeting system is used which calls for fast reflex combinations.  The game supports the latest virtual reality technology as well as having multi-player mode which enables up to 32 people to play head to head.\nEven though it’s a slick action game the story is very important part of your journey, as well as being your call to action it will reveal revelations along your action packed ride. Some of the story is told at high pace but there are some slower paced transition sections at the end of each level where we develop the narrative for the player. Without giving too much away you have someone guiding you through the game who talks to you telepathically. Their role is not only to orientate you but to help unfold the story for the player as you find out who you are and why you’re on the ship.\nThe Oculus Rift mode literally transports you inside the Infinity spaceship to be totally immersed in the thick of the action. The game-play is designed to complement the VR mode so you get the best experience possible and it enhances the game by adding another dimension to the playing experience.\nThere is also another feature that transforms the game into a unique experience, the multi-player mode. This allows up to a 32 players to battle it out head to head to find out who’s the ultimate Infinity Runner.\nInfinity Runner packs a lot into one super slick sci-fi action game bundle and with it re-invents the running genre!\nFEATURES\n* WEREWOLVES IN SPACE!\n* 14 ACTION PACKED LEVELS\n* ARCADE MODE\n* STORY-MODE\n* OCULUS RIFT MODE (DK1 - DK2 Runtime 4.4)\n* WOLF LEVELLING SYSTEM\n* MULTI-PLAYER MODE WITH UP TO 32 PLAYERS\nSTARSHIP INFINITY SPECIFICATION\nOver 150 miles long and nearly 30 miles in diameter at its widest point, the progress of The Infinity's construction at the Tranquillity Ship yards on the Moon could clearly be seen from Earth. The revolutionary ship requires a crew of 5,000,000 people to keep it running and is designed to house another 10 million people as general population ready for the colonisation of new worlds. The Bio-domes, seen along the side of the ship, house forests that cover nearly 60,000 square miles in total, providing oxygen and a food source for the population and an environment for rest and relaxation. The greatest technological achievement can be found in the engine room, which houses the revolutionary Infinity Drive. It is vastly smaller than previous engines at a mere 10 miles long and far more powerful than traditional models which would take up to a third of the length of a starship, creating space for more brave colonists heading out into the unknown.",

      "description_html": "Somewhere along the venerable Route 7, in the middle of nowhere, you will find Joe’s Diner. As an employee working the graveyard shift for the next month, your primary task is to keep the tables clean – no tough challenge at all.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there’s a rub to it. The old Diner was built on the site of a former Indian cemetery. Amongst the buried, two rival chieftains are laid to rest; while alive each could not stand the other.<br/><br/>One chieftain endeavors only to rest in peace. The other, a prankster both in life and the afterlife, is prone to ruffle the feathers of his fellow chief.<br/><br/>Besides your tasks as a waiter, it’s up to you to keep things calm and not incur the angry chieftains’ wrath. To lay them both to everlasting rest just do your duty. Sounds easy but it’s not – promised.Features<ul><li>Work over 30 night shifts as a holiday replacement in Joe’s Diner<br/></li><li>Keep things calm to not incur the angry chieftains’ wrath<br/></li><li>Atmospheric graphics with fantastic lighting<br/></li><li>Innovative gameplay<br/></li><li>Deactivate all objects after the chieftain does his monkey business<br/></li><li>Premium sound scenery and effects<br/></li><li>From the makers of “Pineview Drive”</li></ul>",

The player then can race against computer-controlled characters in fifteen tracks divided into three leagues.\nF-Zero has been acknowledged by critics as one of the greatest video games of all time as well for setting the standard for the racing genre and the creation of its futuristic subgenre.

      "description": "Being originally designed and developed for the SEGA Mega Drive & SEGA Genesis, Pier Solar is a turn-based RPG with state-of-the-art aesthetics about the journey of three young heroes from the town of Reja. In this prospered and peaceful town there live three best friends: Hoston, Alina and Edessot. Young and curious, they want to go on a herb-seeking quest to help cure Hoston's father's mysterious illness. Little do they know ... it will be the beginning of their lifetime journey where they will learn the true meaning of friendship and the thrill of adventure.\nThis journey will demand their courage and wisdom to solve a long-lost mystery while they face the forces of destruction dispatched by an evil man who is trying to change the world for his own good. Through this escapade, they will be reborn as great heroes to protect the universe from a mistaken purpose..What makes Pier Solar so special?\nPier Solar was originally designed and developed for the SEGA Mega Drive and SEGA Genesis. Yes, you read that right!! It was actually the only newly  developed game for SEGA's 16-bit system in the new millennium. It's not a port, fan translation, or a copy of any other game. Pier Solar is a 100% brand new, entirely original,16-bit RPG.\nWe'll get right in to what we think makes Pier Solar so special:\nA 100% Original RPG! Pier Solar was developed from the ground up. An original world, storyline, soundtrack, characters, enemies, and battle style. No ports, translations or copying from any other game - it's all fresh! The first original 16-bit RPG to do this in over a decade!\nA Massive World to Explore! Pier Solar has 50+ hours of gameplay, over 300 locations, nearly 500 unique treasure chests, and over 800 NPCs!\nDirector's cut! Pier Solar expands what was the biggest 16-bit RPG Ever! We released Pier Solar on a custom 64MEG cartridge (the average SEGA Mega Drive/Genesis game size is 12MEG), making it the biggest 16-bit RPG ever! This allowed us to push the 16-bit medium to a precedent setting level, with state-of-the-art aesthetics and things like full-screen cut scenes, background scaling and 3D modes. But Pier Solar HD is more than just a port, the game is getting a Director's cut, and includes an expanded story with new locations and challenges, that couldn't fit on its original Sega Genesis/Mega Drive release.\nEpic Battle Tactics! We developed an innovative battle system that puts you in control of up to five characters and includes in-depth strategic moves such as counter-attacks and a special strategy called Gather, which stores energy to unleash even more powerful moves and spells!\nTranslated in 6 Languages! Pier Solar is translated in 6 languages: English, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and German.\nAn Original Soundtrack! A beautiful soundtrack written just for Pier Solar that embodies everything great about a classic retro soundtrack!\nThere Are Surprises! We also packed-in many other surprises and secrets like hidden areas and mini-games!\nPier Solar truly is a love letter to the rich, imaginative 16-bit RPGs of a bygone era. We crafted Pier Solar in the same light - with an authentic adventure, that resonates deeply about life, death, love, family, and friendship. Remember the wonder you felt when immersed into your favorite retro RPG? Pier Solar captures that same wonder.What the media says about Pier Solar\n“...this is a game I'll be keeping on my radar. I love the style, the aesthetics, and the classic\nJRPG feel.”\n- Kotaku.com\n“...one promising title to play next December.”\n- Destructoid\n“Pier Solar bears the distinct honour of being a Sega Mega Drive game”\n- Eurogamer\n“WaterMelon’s attention to detail is staggering…a community-based development team with a\ntrack record of integrity and a proving capacity to deliver on promises made”\n- Gamespot.com\n“With a lengthy script, impressive graphics, and a top-notch soundtrack, those that still hold the\nflame for SEGA’s console will have something new to be nostalgic over.\n- IGN.com\n“The game itself, which comes on a high-density, 64 Meg cartridge, is a well-crafted love letter\nto the turn-based, role playing games of a bygone era. It’s evocative of the 16-bit classics\nPhantasy Star II and The Secret of Mana, both in scope and design. Pier Solar also sports an\nenhanced CD soundtrack that truly takes the overall experience to another level.”\n- 1UP.com\n“90% GOLD Award…the best RPG of Sega’s 16 bit…well developed [and] well written.”\n- Games TribuneIn a nutshell\nPier Solar is a product of passion, done by individuals who love video games in it's most pure essence. It's made by players for players. Our team has absolute commitment to the quality of the game as well as the experience of the players.",

F-Zero is the first game of the F-Zero series, and was one of the two launch titles (along with Super Mario World) for the SNES in Japan; but was accompanied by additional initial titles in North America and Europe. It was re-released for the Virtual Console service on the Wii in late 2006, the Wii U in early 2013, and on the New Nintendo 3DS in early 2016.

The player can choose between one of four characters in the game, each with their respective hovercar. The player then can race against computer-controlled characters in fifteen tracks divided into three leagues.\nF-Zero has been acknowledged by critics as one of the greatest video games of all time as well for setting the standard for the racing genre and the creation of its futuristic subgenre. Critics lauded F-Zero for its fast and challenging gameplay, variety of tracks, and extensive use of the graphical mode called \"Mode 7\". This graphics-rendering technique was an innovative technological achievement at the time that made racing games more realistic, the first of which was F-Zero.

      "description": "The fourth game in the Scribblenauts series follows the same basic mechanics as the previous three. You play as Max, who owns a magic notebook. Scribe any word in it, and it becomes real (of course, only if the word you wrote describes a particular object). The game will understand your written words and create interactive in-game objects. They are used to solve puzzles, which earns you Starites, the ultimate goal of the game. The ability to summon any imaginable item gives you an almost unlimited number of ways you can solve any puzzle.\nScribblenauts Unlimited features a way more detailed plot than its predecessors. There's an extensive backstory that explains the protagonist's motivation in gathering Starites. We learn that Max and his sister Lily played pranks on people using their magic notebook until it got them into trouble. One day they unknowingly played a trick against an old wizard. He grew angry and magically turned Lily into stone. Max can only save his sister by gathering enough Starites. Unlike previous parts, this game is set in an open, albeit cartoonish, world, that gradually opens to you as you gather more Starites. The tasks are now assigned by the NPCs, and Starites are given as a reward for help. Thus, they serve as the proof that Max has corrected his behavior.",

The main heroine abandons her genie powers and stars adjusting to the life of a regular human being. One day she comes across the previous game’s antagonist, a pirate named Risky Boots that tells her about evil and fearsome tyrant Pirate Master sealed long ago by genies wants to revive himself using Dark Magic.

The game mostly consists of fighting enemies, solving puzzles, platforming sections, interacting with different NPC that can give you quests or sell useful items. Since Shantae abandoned her genie powers, in this game you do not use magic abilities, instead of throughout the game you collect different pirate items such as a pistol, a pirate hat, pirate boots, scimitar, and cannon.

The game was released in Japan on November 21, 1990, in North America in August 1991, and in Europe in 1992. F-Zero is the first game of the F-Zero series, and was one of the two launch titles (along with Super Mario World) for the SNES in Japan; but was accompanied by additional initial titles in North America and Europe. It was re-released for the Virtual Console service on the Wii in late 2006, the Wii U in early 2013, and on the New Nintendo 3DS in early 2016. Nintendo re-released F-Zero in the United States in September 2017 as part of the company's Super NES Classic Edition.\nThe game takes place in the year 2560, where multi-billionaires with lethargic lifestyles created a new form of entertainment based on the Formula One races called \"F-Zero\". The player can choose between one of four characters in the game, each with their respective hovercar. The player then can race against computer-controlled characters in fifteen tracks divided into three leagues.\nF-Zero has been acknowledged by critics as one of the greatest video games of all time as well for setting the standard for the racing genre and the creation of its futuristic subgenre. Critics lauded F-Zero for its fast and challenging gameplay, variety of tracks, and extensive use of the graphical mode called \"Mode 7\". This graphics-rendering technique was an innovative technological achievement at the time that made racing games more realistic, the first of which was F-Zero. As a result, IGN credited it for reinvigorating the genre and inspiring the future creation of numerous racing games. In retrospective reviews of the game critics agreed that it should have used a multiplayer mode.",

Nintendo re-released F-Zero in the United States in September 2017 as part of the company&#39;s Super NES Classic Edition.<br />\nThe game takes place in the year 2560, where multi-billionaires with lethargic lifestyles created a new form of entertainment based on the Formula One races called &quot;F-Zero&quot;. The player can choose between one of four characters in the game, each with their respective hovercar. The player then can race against computer-controlled characters in fifteen tracks divided into three leagues.<br />\nF-Zero has been acknowledged by critics as one of the greatest video games of all time as well for setting the standard for the racing genre and the creation of its futuristic subgenre. Critics lauded F-Zero for its fast and challenging gameplay, variety of tracks, and extensive use of the graphical mode called &quot;Mode 7&quot;. This graphics-rendering technique was an innovative technological achievement at the time that made racing games more realistic, the first of which was F-Zero. As a result, IGN credited it for reinvigorating the genre and inspiring the future creation of numerous racing games. In retrospective reviews of the game critics agreed that it should have used a multiplayer mode.</p>",

There are several underground worlds to explore which feature various enemies. \n\nIf the player gets lost in the mine they can either use the ladders that are sold in the store or use the self-destruct button.

You can play up to 4 players locally and up to 8 players online. Go and build your own tracks, share them with friends or play with them in your tracks. Super Toy Cars is big and with lots of options for you to tinkle and play with, but most importantly this game has been carefully crafted to be fun play and fun to race, either alone or with friends.\nThere are 16 different cars in the game each one with its unique handling model. You can experiment with them and play the ones that best suite your driving style and the different situations you'll find in our 12 tracks. Oh, and maybe you'll want to use different cars depending on which type of event you're playing, because we have 48 events in career mode, but not all of them are races! And if you grow tired of the tracks in the game you can always check what other tracks have the community built or even build your own and share it with our in-game track editor.\nFeatures:\n16 different cars with unique handling models\n12 different tracks in 4 different locations which can be played in 5 different event types\nCareer mode comprising 48 events\nUp to 4 player local multiplayer\nUp to 8 player online multiplayer\nTrack editor to build and share your own tracksEarly Access Roadmap\nWe have a roadmap in place for the period the game is going to be in Early Access. We are aiming for a final release date in the first or second week of May. We have roughly 10 weeks to that date and we're planning to do, at least, weekly builds with improvements. We'll be announcing what's new in every build in the announcements section, but anyway here's the planned roadmap:\nMarch, 3rd: Mostly bugfixing and online improvements. Possibly some improvements in the HUD and menus.\nMarch, 10th: Improved menus backgrounds, improved HUD, better and more consistent AI accross the game. Achievement icons.\nMarch, 17th: More effects and particle systems. Bugfixing.\nMarch, 24th: First batch of vehicle paintjobs.\nApril, 7th: Mac version. Second batch of vehicle paintjobs.\nApril, 21st: Linux version. All vehicles have, at least, 2 paintjobs available.\nApril, 28th: Some easter eggs, and other bonuses. Maybe provide a first alpha of a vehicle editor.\nBear in mind that this list is meant to change and adapt to your suggestions and feedback. Although we can't guarantee we'll implement every detail and suggestion we receive, we'll do our best to react to community feedback and make of Super Toy Cars the best game we can with your help.",

Super Toy Cars is big and with lots of options for you to tinkle and play with, but most importantly this game has been carefully crafted to be fun play and fun to race, either alone or with friends.<br/><br/>There are 16 different cars in the game each one with its unique handling model. You can experiment with them and play the ones that best suite your driving style and the different situations you'll find in our 12 tracks. Oh, and maybe you'll want to use different cars depending on which type of event you're playing, because we have 48 events in career mode, but not all of them are races! And if you grow tired of the tracks in the game you can always check what other tracks have the community built or even build your own and share it with our in-game track editor.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/><ul><li>16 different cars with unique handling models<br/></li><li>12 different tracks in 4 different locations which can be played in 5 different event types<br/></li><li>Career mode comprising 48 events<br/></li><li>Up to 4 player local multiplayer<br/></li><li>Up to 8 player online multiplayer<br/></li><li>Track editor to build and share your own tracks</li></ul>Early Access Roadmap<br/>We have a roadmap in place for the period the game is going to be in Early Access. We are aiming for a final release date in the first or second week of May. We have roughly 10 weeks to that date and we're planning to do, at least, weekly builds with improvements. We'll be announcing what's new in every build in the announcements section, but anyway here's the planned roadmap:<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>March, 3rd:</strong> Mostly bugfixing and online improvements. Possibly some improvements in the HUD and menus.<br/></li><li><strong>March, 10th:</strong> Improved menus backgrounds, improved HUD, better and more consistent AI accross the game. Achievement icons.<br/></li><li><strong>March, 17th:</strong> More effects and particle systems. Bugfixing.<br/></li><li><strong>March, 24th:</strong> First batch of vehicle paintjobs. <br/></li><li><strong>April, 7th:</strong> Mac version. Second batch of vehicle paintjobs.<br/></li><li><strong>April, 21st:</strong> Linux version. All vehicles have, at least, 2 paintjobs available.<br/></li><li><strong>April, 28th:</strong> Some easter eggs, and other bonuses. Maybe provide a first alpha of a vehicle editor.</li></ul><br/>Bear in mind that this list is meant to change and adapt to your suggestions and feedback. Although we can't guarantee we'll implement every detail and suggestion we receive, we'll do our best to react to community feedback and make of Super Toy Cars the best game we can with your help.",

His creator, Dr. White, sends him to stop his rampaging kin and find out who is behind the attack. The Xel technology allows Beck to bring his fellow Numbers back to reason.

Like in Mega Man, the protagonist jumps platforms and fires a gun. Beck can also use the special acceleration ability that allows him to leap long distances and through his enemies. By leaping through injured opponents, Beck can assimilate their Xel to receive a temporary power-up.

      "description": "Toki Tori is a puzzle video game with platform elements originally released by Capcom in September 2001 for the Game Boy Color. It was developed by Dutch video game development company Two Tribes B.V. and is their first published video game. The game follows a young chick, Toki Tori, and his quest to rescue his younger siblings, still in their eggs. To progress through the game, the player must pick up each egg on a level using a set number of tools, with new tools being introduced as the player progresses through the four worlds. This usually involves careful planning and creative thinking.\nToki Tori was later released for Windows Mobile and an enhanced remake was released for Nintendo's Wii via WiiWare. In the Summer of 2009, Chillingo published another enhanced remake of the game for the iOS. In 2010, Two Tribes released a Windows remake on Steam. A DRM-free version of the game was released on January 2012 as part of the Humble Bundle for Android. This marked a simultaneous release of the game on OS X, Linux and Android. The original version of the game was re-released on the Nintendo 3DS eShop as a Virtual Console title on 31 August 2012, and an HD port of the game was released for the Wii U eShop on 7 November 2013. An updated version of Toki Tori was released on the Nintendo 3DS eShop on 5 November 2015.",

Your objective is simple yet nerve-wracking: find the only exit before the situation becomes fatal.Explore an endless cave\nIn Underground, you will explore a vast network of caves with no obvious visual landmarks. Every corner could be a dead-end, and danger is ever-present. The game's textures are designed to create an immersive atmosphere, with detailed and realistic environments that amplify the sense of isolation and claustrophobia. To survive, you must find your way through narrow passages, crawl through tight spaces, and search for the exit before all hope fades.Survival in the dark\nYour only tool: a flashlight that provides weak illumination. But beware: one wrong move could cost you your life. Underground is a ruthless game where every movement matters, and caution is your only ally. The total darkness and constant tension make every corner uncertain, forcing you to move slowly, always on edge.A predator is hunting you\nA strange and terrifying creature lurks in the shadows, an unpredictable predator waiting for the slightest misstep. You can never know where it is, but it follows you, listening for every noise, every shadow. Learn to detect signs of its presence—sounds, changes in light—and try to escape its pursuit, or face the fatal consequences of the encounter.No second chances\nLearning from failure is an integral part of Underground. Each attempt will help you better understand the cave, its structure, and refine your strategies. But if you make a mistake, there's no going back: no save points, no easy paths. The exit is in your hands, but it's fleeting.Estimated playtime: between 30 minutes and several hours\nWith a labyrinthine map to explore and an unpredictable threat, each session can last anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours depending on your progress and ability to navigate the chaos of the caves. Every mistake brings you closer to the exit… or to death.Key Features :\n• Explore a labyrinthine cave network: Narrow passages and tight spaces. Exploration is a challenge in itself, where every turn can be fatal.\n• Survive the darkness: Your only light, a flashlight, will guide you through this threatening world. The darkness is also your enemy, and every movement in the shadows could cost you dearly.\n• An unpredictable predator hunts you: Stay vigilant—it could be anywhere, at any time. A deadly, elusive enemy moves randomly with you, ready to strike when you least expect it.\n• Ruthless gameplay: Learn from your mistakes and refine your strategies to survive in this cave network. Caution and intelligence will be your only allies.\n• No map, no landmarks: Rely only on your sense of direction and awareness to find the exit. Every turn could be a dead-end, and every sound could be a warning.\n• Immersive and realistic atmosphere: Detailed textures and an oppressive sound atmosphere immerse the player in an increasingly threatening environment.\n• Crawl your way through: Use narrow passages to sneak past the creature or find new routes to the exit. Every movement counts.No customization or configuration : just pure gaming.Moderate violence : the gameplay contains very little violence to remain open to a wide audience._____________________________________________________This game is for those who love uncompromising challenges and are ready to venture into the unknown. Prepare to face your fears in Underground.Good Luck !",

      "description": "Volgarr the Viking is a 2D action-platformer inspired by classic platformers such as Ghosts ‘n Goblins and Rastan. \n\n### Gameplay  \nThe game follows a Viking named Volgarr summoned by Odin to defeat an evil dragon. The gameplay shares many similarities with old-school side-scrollers.\nThe game consists of six main worlds and one secret level. Each of the world except the final one, divided into two part: an open area referred to as ‘level’ and a ‘temple’ with a boss on the end of it. On every stage, you have to go from the beginning to finish slaying monsters on your way and picking up treasures and power-ups. Volgarr has two weapons: throwing the spear and a sword. Throwing spear can be charged, and if it hits the wall, it serves as a platform that allows player achieve secret places. Additionally, Volgarr can pick up Mjolnir’s Blessing, a power-up that kills all non-boss enemies on the screen upon taking a hit. The hero has several different moves to fight the enemies and getting through platforming sequences such as jumping slash, crouching slash and down thrust. \nThe player can collect treasures scattered throughout the levels.

The game was released in Japan on November 21, 1990, in North America in August 1991, and in Europe in 1992. F-Zero is the first game of the F-Zero series, and was one of the two launch titles (along with Super Mario World) for the SNES in Japan; but was accompanied by additional initial titles in North America and Europe. It was re-released for the Virtual Console service on the Wii in late 2006, the Wii U in early 2013, and on the New Nintendo 3DS in early 2016. Nintendo re-released F-Zero in the United States in September 2017 as part of the company's Super NES Classic Edition.\nThe game takes place in the year 2560, where multi-billionaires with lethargic lifestyles created a new form of entertainment based on the Formula One races called \"F-Zero\". The player can choose between one of four characters in the game, each with their respective hovercar. The player then can race against computer-controlled characters in fifteen tracks divided into three leagues.\nF-Zero has been acknowledged by critics as one of the greatest video games of all time as well for setting the standard for the racing genre and the creation of its futuristic subgenre. Critics lauded F-Zero for its fast and challenging gameplay, variety of tracks, and extensive use of the graphical mode called \"Mode 7\". This graphics-rendering technique was an innovative technological achievement at the time that made racing games more realistic, the first of which was F-Zero. As a result, IGN credited it for reinvigorating the genre and inspiring the future creation of numerous racing games. In retrospective reviews of the game critics agreed that it should have used a multiplayer mode.",
